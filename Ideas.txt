TODO:

- game mechanics:
	- Animated title screen
	- Select save file menu
	- input random seed for level generation
	- Not all enemies/Bosses are in the main dungeon 
	- small secret dungeons with optional items
	- Dungeon size and Boss difficulty varies (depending on the intended dungeon sequence)
	- Dungeon sequence depends on the number of required items to enter
	- Little sequence breaks in later dungeons (hookshot, bombs etc.) that shorten that dungeon

- Items:
	- Sword
	- Lamp
	- Hookshot
	- Bow
	- Magic staff (multiple different magics)
	- Bombs
	- Bottle
	- Teleporter

- Equipment:
	- Different Armors (Swimming Gear, Heat Protection, ...)
	- Better Swords and Shields
	- Magic Wings (enables jumping)

- Abilities/Perks:
	- Swim faster
	- Sword techniques (spin attack, sword beam)

- NPCs:
	- Merchant
	- Quest givers
	- Sword Master (exchange collectibles for sword techniques: free to choose, but the next
	  one is more expensive)
	- animals (pigs, birds, butterflies etc). pigs get angry when hit

- Game World
	- Overworld: 
		- Different Bioms (Different Tilesets, Enemies, Obstacles) 
		- semi randomized Towns
		- hand-crafted landmarks within a randomized overworld
		- collectibles (rupees, heart containers, magic enhancements) in semi-fixed locations,
		  but randomized within chests
		- Mini games (in later towns and in the overworld)
		- Castle is in the middle (sort of hub world like in Minish Cap)
		- One big randomized fetch quests (you get vague tips on where the next person is
		  if you ask NPCs with the current item in your inventory)
		- some one- or two-room caves with a little puzzle to get the item
		  (or the item is locked behind an inventory item)
		- caves with two exits that have two entrances in the overworld
	
	- Dungeons:
		- Randomized Rooms
		- One Item, A room set for each item (requires item to progress)
		- Some rooms requiring different item for backtracking
		- midi Bosses (bigger version of existing enemy)
		- enemy set in line with dungeon setting
		- Each dungeon has a sub theme (a overarching task to complete,
		  like activating a number of levers to open the way to the boss,
		  fighting three bigger bosses,
		  finding shards for the boss key,
		  lowering water/lava levels
		- dungeons have (one or more) optional side quests
		- dungeons have multiple floors (later dungeons have more)

	- Dungeon Settings:
		- Keep/Castle (with Sewers)
			- rescue a prisoner from a cell for a side quest in the overworld
			- a sewer rat has the key
		- Jungle Shrine
			- Save an NPC that follows you
		- Volcano
		- Icy Cave
		- Pyramid
			- you have to raid all the grave chambers to awaken the ghost of the pharao
		- Obligatory Water Level
		 	- each floor can be completely flooded (has at least two floors)
			  and becomes inaccessible
			- rooms have two layers (one that can be flooded)
			- floating platforms
			- a mermaid lost her ring that you have to retrieve from an enemy (a random shark has it, 
	     		  that shark has a slightly different color)
		- Final Dungeon (once all dungeons have been completed)
		  Final Boss with an additional phase if player collected 100% of the items (true ending)
		  Dungeon is also harder then

- Story:
	- The King (which sits in the castle in the center of the map) is gone mad
	- But the player doesn't know initially
	- you are a member of the King's sworn knights
	- the king senses an evil presence and requires you to fetch 6 powerful relics from ancient temples
	  that he needs to protect the realm from this "evil"
	- you travel the world and collect the relics. After each dungeon you are sent back to the castle.
	  The king becomes more mad with every relic, until finally he has all 6 relics and transforms into
	  an evil being that wants to destroy the kingdom. He transforms his castle into the final dungeon, the
	  Dark Castle, where you have to defeat him to end the game
