# DungeonCrusaderV03

## Overview
This is the third version of this project and just in its beginnings. 
You are a (yet nameless) sworn knight that is sent by a mad king to retrieve ancient relics that are prophesied to conquer a approaching evil.

The final game should feature a new, semi-randomized experience in every playthrough. The game world consists of several towns with NPCs and (optional) quests, and dungeons with different themes, increasing size and difficulty.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 (I might refactor later for backwards compatibility)
- pygame 1.9.6
- PyTMX 3.21.7

## Execution
Download the Project Folder and execute `src/run.py` to play.<br/>
Creating a virtual environment from `requirements.txt` is adviced.

## Controls (so far)
The Game also supports the XBOX Game Pad
